# Born-Digital Camera Original Video Formats
This repository provides introductory scripts for packaging, transferring, and verifying born-digital camera original video formats. 
All scripts are written in bash. The scripts generally assume the best-case scenario that you are transferring files directly off of 
a flash memory card (like an SD, SxS, or a CF card), but they can be adapted for use with files coming from any source or configuration.
